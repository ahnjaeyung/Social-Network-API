## Description  
![Social Network API Gif](./Assets/socNetApiDemo.gif)  

This is an API that was built for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.  This API was built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and Moment.js to format timestamps.

This application was created using technologies such as:
* JavaScript
* Node
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Moment
* Insomnia
* Screencastify

Some of the methods used in creating this application were found from resources such as W3Schools, MDN Web Docs, and Stack Overflow.
